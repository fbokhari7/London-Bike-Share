# |  cnt   |  the count of a new bike shares.  |  
# |  t1   |  real temperature in C. |  
# |  t2   | temperature in C "feels like".|  
# |  hum	| humidity in percentage.   |  
# |  windspeed	|  wind speed in km/h.  |  
# |  weather_code   |  category of the weather. |

# There is a weak positive correlation between month and count(0.063757) suggests a slight tendency for bike shares to increase with higher month numbers.
# There is a weak negative correlation between days of the week and count(-0.068688) indicates a slight tendency for bike shares to decrease on later days of the week.

# Bike Share Analysis Report
# 
# Introduction:
# In this report, we analyze the factors influencing bike share based on a dataset containing information such as temperature, weather conditions, day of the week, and hour of the day. The goal is to understand how these factors affect bike share counts.
# 
# Key Findings:
# 
# Temperature:
# Correlation: There is a strong positive correlation (0.99) between temp_real_C and temp_feels_like_C, indicating that these variables are highly positively correlated, which is expected since they both relate to temperature.
# Impact: Higher temperatures are associated with more bike shares, as shown by the moderate positive correlation (0.389) between temp_real_C and count.
# Humidity:
# Correlation: There is a moderate negative correlation (-0.463) between humidity_percent and count, indicating that higher humidity is associated with fewer bike shares.
# Impact: Bike shares decrease as humidity increases, suggesting that comfort levels influence shares decisions.
# Day of the Week and Month:
# Correlation: There is a weak positive correlation (0.063757) between month and count, suggesting a slight tendency for bike shares to increase with higher month numbers.
# There is a weak negative correlation (-0.068688) between dayofweek and count, indicating a slight tendency for bike shares to decrease on later days of the week.
# Hourly Usage:
# Correlation: There is a weak positive correlation (0.32) between hour and count, indicating that certain hours of the day are associated with higher bike shares counts. 
# Usage Patterns: Bike shares peak during rush hours on weekdays, suggesting that people use bikes for commuting.
# Weather Conditions:
# Weather Impact: Bike shares are higher on clear days, followed by broken clouds or scattered cloudy days. Good weather is associated with increased bike rentals.
# Seasonal Trends:
# Seasonal Impact: Bike shares increase during summer and decrease during winter, indicating a seasonal pattern in bike usage.
# Conclusion:
# Overall, this analysis highlights the impact of various factors on bike shares. Temperature, humidity, day of the week, and hour of the day all play a role in determining bike shares counts.
