This repository contains a dataset and code for bike sharing demand. The dataset contains 17,414 observations of 10 variables, including timestamp, count of new bike shares, real temperature, "feels like" temperature, humidity, windspeed, weather code, holiday status, weekend status, and season. The code includes Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing and evaluation.
